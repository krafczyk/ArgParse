Features which ought to be implemented:

- The user should be able to specify where to stop parsing arguments.
  I propose the use of '--' to delineate this. i.e.
  ./program --arg1 blah --arg2 blah -- otherarg otherarg
  should result in arg1 and arg2 being processed, and then argc, argv
  should be transformed and passed to the user so they may pass these args
  to another argument parsing program such as Qt.


- AddArgument functions should be added which are identical to 'AddOption'
  functions. The 'AddOption' function should eventually be phased out. 'AddOption'
  is not a good description since the library is called after all 'ArgParse' and
  is to take after the Python version.


- Argument groups should be implemented


- Argument groups should have an inclusive mode and an exclusive mode.


- Proper handling of --arg=value vs. --arg value should be implemented.
  we should also think of whether we should take --arg= value and
  --arg =value, Perhaps we can but with a warning?
