Features which ought to be implemented:

- Argument groups should be implemented


- Argument groups should have an inclusive mode and an exclusive mode.


Completed Features

x Update licenses for 2015

x Option class replaced with Argument class. names and variables changed
  accordingly.

x Addition of unittests

x Proper handling of --arg=value vs. --arg value should be implemented.
  we should not take things like --arg= value or --arg =value

x Arguments should be specified like -blah/--b/-s/blah/test etc..

x The user should be able to specify where to stop parsing arguments.
  I propose the use of '--' to delineate this. i.e.
  ./program --arg1 blah --arg2 blah -- otherarg otherarg
  should result in arg1 and arg2 being processed, and then argc, argv
  should be transformed and passed to the user so they may pass these args
  to another argument parsing program such as Qt.
